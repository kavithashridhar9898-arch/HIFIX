## Adding Your Video

1. **Download or create a video** that fits your HIFIX theme
   - Recommended: Home repair/service worker themed video
   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
   - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
   - File size: Keep it under 5MB for better performance

2. **Place the video file** in this folder (`frontend/assets/videos/`)
   - Name it: `login-bg.mp4`

3. **Video suggestions:**
   - Tools being used (hammer, screwdriver, wrench)
   - Worker doing home repairs
   - Construction/renovation time-lapse
   - Smooth, professional, subtle motion
   - Dark/muted colors that won't interfere with text

## Alternative: Use a Gradient Background

If you don't want to use a video, the app will automatically fall back to a gradient background.
